Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

Overview

Sentiment analysis is a critical tool for understanding public opinion and emotions towards various entities, including movies. This project focuses on classifying movie reviews as positive or negative using machine learning techniques. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning algorithms, the objective is to build and compare models capable of effectively analyzing movie review sentiments.

Project Objectives

Dataset Exploration: Analyze a movie review dataset to understand patterns and trends in sentiment expression.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the textual data using tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization.

Feature Engineering: Convert text data into numerical formats using techniques like TF-IDF and Word Embeddings.

Model Development: Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest.

Performance Evaluation: Compare model performances using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the best classifier.
